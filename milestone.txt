Cheng-yu Hong (cs184-eh)
Linda Dai (cs184-aq)

Scene: We will start with a view of the front of a castle, with a moat and a drawbridge.
Then, we will enter the castle and explore the hallways and rooms, including the armory and the dining halls.

Goals/Plans: Implement all the requirements on the specs. By October 28, we want to finish texture mapping,
loading obj files, one hand-drawn object, place objects in the scene at correct locations, and basic camera framework,
lighting, shading, turning on/off texture (wireframe), and animation. We plan to use the last few days for testing/debugging.

Linda will implement the object drawing using openGL, hand-drawn objects, camera movements, and animation.
Cheng-yu will implement the texture mapping, loading object files, and turning on/off texture. At the end, we will
merge the parts and focus on lighting, shading, animation, and basically finish the rest of the scene.

Already implemented: We implemented drawing the outlines for most of the objects and began placing them in the scene.
Add more at end of week!!
