Cheng-yu Hong (cs184-eh)
Linda Dai (cs184-aq)

Scene: We will start with a view of the front of a castle, with a moat and a drawbridge.
Then, we will enter the castle and explore the hallways and rooms, including the armory and the dining halls.

Goals: Implement all the requirements on the specs. By the end of next week, we want to finish texture mapping,
loading obj files, one hand-drawn object, place objects in the scene at correct locations, and basic camera framework.
The following week, we want to finish lighting and complete the scene.

Already implemented: We implemented drawing the outlines for most of the objects and began placing them in the scene.

Plan to fulfill tasks: We will go through the tasks one-by-one and split up the work accordingly. Linda will implement
camera/mouse movements and hand-drawn object. Cheng-yu will implement texture mapping.
